FixtureMaker

A tool that for automatically creating fixtures which follow all foreign key relationships for a given QuerySet

Usage:

1) Put the script somewhere in your django project.

2) Make a folder in the same directory as manage.py named 'fixture_maker'

3) Run python manage.py shell

4) Get your QuerySet

5) import FixtureMaker, 'from fk_fixture_maker import FixtureMaker'

6) Instantiate FixtureMaker with your QuerySet. eg FixtureMaker(your_QuerySet)

7) Enjoy jSON fixtures for all foreign key connections in your queryset!\

8) This is still a work in progress so please bear with me.
